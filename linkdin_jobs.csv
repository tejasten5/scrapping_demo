"Software Development Engineer I (Networking Applications), AWS Networking - Configuration Services",Amazon Web Services (AWS),"Cupertino, CA",5 hours ago,"$128,000/yr - $180,000/yr (LinkedIn est.) · Full-time · Mid-Senior level","10,001+ employees · IT Services and IT Consulting","Job Summary

DESCRIPTION

What do we do here? Amazon Web Services (AWS) runs one of the largest networks in the world. We are changing the way Networks are conceived, designed, built and operated, by adopting the principles of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Intent Based Networking (IBN). We derive our network topologies from higher level designs and intents, and a distributed software system controls the way we manage our network. We put services and algorithms in place to control and manage all layers of the Amazon network, from top of the rack switches in our datacenters (TORs) to our internet and private backbone facing routers.

Why do we do that? At Amazon, we are always customer obsessed. By creating an intent-based, scalable network, we respond quickly and safely to network changes like scaling, maintenance, failure, security and other types of events. This also lowers the cost and overhead for customers, while driving up performance, availability and reliability.

Why now? We want to expand scope of our IBN and configuration backend systems to store and vend operational intent, there by facilitating anomaly detection. We also would expand our description languages, parsers and workflow engines to go beyond the mostly static configuration elements and cover dynamic and operational elements. To achieve this we need to expand our current team focusing on IBN related areas. We are looking for talented software engineers who want to get hands on experience with fully automated hyper scale data center networks, cloud infrastructure, large-scale software deployments, algorithms, distributed systems and service oriented architectures (SOA).

How do we operate in our team? We empower our engineers to take ownership of their realm and make a difference. They start by gathering requirements, diving deep to choose technologies, designing features and spinning new services, coding and reviewing, deploying software across the globe and maintaining services. In AWS, we are nimble and agile, like being part of a startup, innovating while collaborating with a smart group of people around you. We are thrilled about how software is changing the landscape of networking. We operate on an unimaginable scale. We push the boundaries in robustness, fault-tolerance and smart adaptive algorithms that can react intelligently to real-world events. Software engineers on our team contribute to every phase of the development process and deploy scalable software systems worldwide.

What will you be doing here?
Designing and developing network management software for highly scaled networks, using SDN, IBN principles combined with traditional routing/switching solutions.
Working with management, customers and other engineering teams to develop state of the art solutions, incorporating new technologies, algorithms and innovations.
Who are we looking for? Smart, talented engineers. You do not need to have networking background up front. Join us if you like working hard, having fun and making history. We do just that.

Have more questions? Talk to us! We'll be happy to setup an info call to give you more context and details about the job.


Basic Qualifications
Programming experience with at least one software programming language.
